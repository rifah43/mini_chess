# **Chess pieces**
### **White:**
King c1; Queen d1; Rook a1; Bishop b1; Knight e1; Pawn a2, b2, c2, d2, e2.

# **Game Rules**
* The king moves exactly one square horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
* A rook moves any number of vacant squares horizontally or vertically.
* A bishop moves any number of vacant squares diagonally.
* The queen moves any number of vacant squares horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
* A knight moves to one of the nearest squares not on the same rank, file, or diagonal. (This can be thought of as moving two squares horizontally then one square vertically, or moving one square horizontally then two squares verticallyâ€”i.e. in an "L" pattern.) The knight is not blocked by other pieces; it jumps to the new location.
* A pawn moves straight forward one square, if that square is vacant. Pawns cannot move backwards.

## **Additional Rules**
* Pawns can only advance one space on their first move. There is no en passant capturing.
* A pawn can only promote to a captured piece.
* There is no castling.
* If 20 moves are played without a capture or promotion, the player with the most `points' on the board wins. (Pawn=1 pt., Bishop/Knight=3, Rook=5, Queen = 9.)


# Moves
## The Pawns Move
The Pawn's movement is direct (i.e. advancing and not retreating or sidestepping). A Pawn takes a single step forward in each move. While capturing, a Pawn moves one square diagonally forward to claim its opponent's piece. Though Pawns normally cannot move diagonally, this is the only way they capture. Among all pieces, the Pawn is unique, capturing in a manner different from its regular movement pattern.
