# Game Rules

## The Pawns Moves
The Pawn moves directly forward, never backward or to the side. Pawns move exactly one square forward; though each Pawn may advance two squares forward the first time it is moved. Pawns capture a piece that is one square diagonally forward. Though Pawns normally cannot move diagonally, this is the only way they capture. Pawns are the only piece that capture differently than they move.
